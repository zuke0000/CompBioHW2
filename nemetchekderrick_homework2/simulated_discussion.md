## What: Briefly describe the results you saw when plotting the frequencies of observed scores for alignments of unrelated sequences. How does this relate to material covered in the text and lecture? Your response should be no more than 250 

I saw the score mean was 65 and the median was 52 with a standard deviation of 11. I believe this relates to the markov model. Despite the scoring matrix leaning more negative numbers, the local alignment cherrypicks values that are positive. Although these sequences are generated randomly, we can predict that two random sequences will have a local alignment within the range of 65 +- 11. Given this data, we can plug it into a markov model to predict if future letters in a segment would match or not. We could also determine if two sequences could be related or not based off the scores of two completely random sequences.
